# How-Long-Does-It-Take-to-Get-a-CDL-A-Complete-Guide-for-2025

If you're looking to start a career in commercial driving, obtaining a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) is a crucial step. But one of the most common questions aspiring truck drivers ask is: How long does it take to get a CDL? The answer depends on several factors, including the type of CDL you want, the training program you choose, and the state's requirements.

In this complete guide for 2025, we break down everything you need to know about the CDL process, how long it typically takes, and tips to speed up your journey to becoming a licensed commercial driver.

What Is a CDL?
A Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) is a special license required to operate large or heavy vehicles such as tractor-trailers, buses, and tankers. The CDL ensures drivers have the skills and knowledge to handle commercial vehicles safely on public roads.

CDLs are classified into three main classes:

Class A: Allows you to operate any combination of vehicles with a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) of 26,001 pounds or more, including trailers.

Class B: For single vehicles with a GVWR of 26,001 pounds or more, such as buses and dump trucks.

Class C: For vehicles designed to transport 16 or more passengers or hazardous materials.

Your training duration and testing requirements may vary depending on the class of CDL you are pursuing.

Step 1: Meet the Eligibility Requirements
Before starting the CDL process, make sure you meet the basic eligibility criteria:

Be at least 18 years old to drive within your state (intrastate).

Be at least 21 years old to drive interstate or transport hazardous materials.

Have a valid non-commercial driver’s license.

Pass a medical exam to obtain a Medical Examiner’s Certificate (DOT physical).

Meeting these requirements is essential before applying for your CDL.

Step 2: Get Your Commercial Learner’s Permit (CLP)
The first official step in getting your CDL is obtaining a Commercial Learner’s Permit (CLP). The CLP allows you to practice driving a commercial vehicle under supervision.

To get your CLP, you must:

Study the CDL manual provided by your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

Pass the written knowledge tests relevant to the CDL class and endorsements you want (e.g., hazardous materials, passenger, tankers).

Pass a vision exam.

Submit proof of identity and residency.

How long does it take to get your CLP?
The written tests can be completed in one day if you are prepared. Many applicants spend 1-2 weeks studying before taking the test. Once you pass, the DMV issues the CLP, which is typically valid for 180 days to 1 year depending on the state.

Step 3: CDL Training Program Duration
After you have your CLP, the next step is CDL training. The duration of CDL training varies significantly depending on the type of program:

1. Professional Truck Driving Schools
Duration: Typically 3-8 weeks.

These intensive programs offer hands-on training combined with classroom instruction.

They prepare you for both the CDL skills test and the real-world demands of truck driving.

Many schools offer job placement assistance upon completion.

2. Community Colleges or Technical Schools
Duration: 1-6 months.

These programs provide more comprehensive instruction, often including extended classroom hours, safety courses, and internships.

May include certifications in specialized endorsements.

3. Company-Sponsored Training Programs
Duration: 3-8 weeks.

Many trucking companies offer paid training programs where you can earn while you learn.

Some require you to sign a contract agreeing to work for them for a specific period after training.

4. Self-Study and Practice
If you already have experience driving large vehicles or want to save money, you can self-study and practice driving with your CLP.

This option may take longer, depending on your ability to find a qualified CDL holder to supervise and your study habits.

Step 4: Pass the CDL Skills Test
Once your training is complete, you must pass the CDL skills test, which consists of three parts:

Pre-trip Vehicle Inspection: Demonstrate your ability to inspect the vehicle for safety.

Basic Vehicle Control: Show your skills in backing up, parking, and maneuvering.

Road Test: Drive on public roads with a tester evaluating your driving skills.

You need to schedule your skills test at a DMV or authorized testing site. The test typically takes a few hours to complete.

How Long Does the Entire CDL Process Take?
Here’s a summary of the typical timeline:

Step	Estimated Time
Studying for CLP written test	1-2 weeks
Taking the written exam and getting CLP	1 day
CDL training program	3-8 weeks (varies)
Scheduling and passing skills test	1 day to 1 week (depends on availability)
Total	Approximately 1 to 3 months

If you choose longer programs or community college courses, it could extend to 4-6 months.

Factors That Can Affect CDL Processing Time
Several factors may speed up or slow down your CDL journey:

State DMV scheduling availability: Some DMVs have long wait times for testing.

Training program length: Choose based on your schedule and career goals.

Endorsements required: Additional tests for hazardous materials or passenger transport can add time.

Your learning pace: Prior driving experience and study habits matter.

Documentation readiness: Medical certificates, IDs, and paperwork delays can slow the process.

Tips to Get Your CDL Faster
Prepare well: Use online practice tests and CDL manuals to study for written exams.

Enroll in intensive training: Short-term professional schools can get you on the road quicker.

Schedule tests early: Book your skills test as soon as you feel ready to avoid delays.

Gather documents early: Get your DOT physical and identification ready before starting.

Consider company training: If you want a job immediately, some companies offer fast-track programs.

What Does It Cost to Get a CDL?
While not directly related to time, it’s important to know the costs involved:

Written test fees: $10-$30 depending on the state.

CDL application fee: $50-$150.

Training program costs: $3,000-$7,000 on average, depending on program length and school.

Endorsement fees: Additional $10-$50 per endorsement.

Some companies cover training costs or reimburse them after employment.

Conclusion
Getting your CDL in 2025 can take anywhere from about one month to six months, depending on your training choice, state requirements, and personal schedule. For most aspiring truck drivers, enrolling in a professional truck driving school and preparing well for tests can speed up the process.

Remember, a CDL opens doors to a stable and rewarding career in commercial driving with good pay and benefits. With proper planning and commitment, you can be behind the wheel and on the road much faster than you think.
